# Capstone Project



In this capstone project, I used NLP for dialects identification in Arabic songs based on lyrics features. It has 7 parts and 2 datasets:

#### Datasets:
* ArabicLyrics: It is the original dataset. Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1goGaz7dRG4DuhmdYiSkj2PoOFTojxSLC
* farasa_lyrics: the dataset after implementing cleaning and lemmatization techniques. Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=12NLPYvrYnM-7JT4gsoVSJTDNom1HfkEG

#### Notebooks:
-------------------
* Data info and description.
* Data Cleaning and lemmatization using FARASA API.
* EDA by creating word-clouds for each dialect.
* Creating world-clouds for NLTK lemmtized lyrics after Count-Vectorizer has been implemented
* Creating world-clouds for Farasa lemmtized lyrics after Count-Vectorizer has been applied. After that ML models has been used to predict the dialect.
* TF-IDF and two ML models been used.
* Word2vec model.
